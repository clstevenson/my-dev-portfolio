## Description

This website app was created to present my development portfolio and showcase my skills and strengths as a developer. The front-end was created with React using `styled-components` and a few [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives. It contains a simple `node.js` back-end to send emails using `nodemailer`.

A screenshot of the top of the portfolio page (as initially deployed) is below.
